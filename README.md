# FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM USING NEURAL NETWORKS

Motivation and Problem Description :
<br>
Credit card fraud is a serious problem that inflicts considerable financial loss on both institutions and 
customers. The central agenda of the issue is in the necessity to identify fraudulent transactions properly, on 
time and correctly in data that is naturally imbalancedâ€”only a very tiny fraction of total transactions are 
fraudulent cases and the data imbalance presents a serious challenge since standard classifiers are usually 
swamped by the majority class, which results in high misclassification rates for the minority (fraud) class. By 
detecting fraudulent transactions in a timely manner, the system not only avoids losses but also improves 
security and trust within digital financial systems.
